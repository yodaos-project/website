# YODAOS Website

### What is this repo?

The website by the YODAOS team builds on the merged community's past website projects to form a self-publishing, community-managed version of the previous site.

### Build

To build the complete website locally, please use:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Or using Makefile:

```sh
$ make dist
```

The above command would generate 2 folders:

* `.tmp` to store source repositories, currently only [yodaos-project/yodart][].
* `dist` to complete website static files.
